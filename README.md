# Starbucks landing page clone
This project makes use of the following :
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript

Also relevant to mention :
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Media queries for responsive design

Here's what I learned by building this project :
My goal for this project was to learn how to properly implement responsiveness using a good HTML structure. It was a success. By trying to imitate an already established website such as Starbucks, I could focus entirely on the code and forget about the design and the content writing. Knowing the end result prior to building it also saved a ton of time. Additionally, this project made me use **Chrome DevTools** a lot. I am confident that this will be of great use for future projects and this will allow me to better test my code. I also learned how to make a hamburger menu for smaller screens such as mobile devices using some javascript and media queries. In my previous project, I couldn't figure it out. This time I understand where it went wrong. I also learned a great deal about **JavaScript** and the **DOM**. For most of my project, I limited my use of REM units to font related use only. In my previous project, using REM units for pretty much everything turned out to be a problem for responsiveness.

Things I should learn/improve upon after building this project :
I am extremely satisfied with how this project turned out. However, it did take me a long time to build this simple landing page. My goal would be to reduce that time. I am currently working on my next project. That project will focus on **JavaScript** and will be an app.
